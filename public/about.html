                As some of you may know I am a personal trainer and fitness instructor in London. I teach spin, circuits, boxing, easytone step and reformer Pilates at a range of gyms but predominantly Fitness First!
              </p>
              <p>
                Since January I have been covering predominantly spin classes and now teach 16 permanent classes a week (spin, circuits and Pilates) along with extras covers wherever I can fit them in.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I started work I was in some serious debt from my MSc in forensic psychology that I had completed 6 months earlier. I soon realised that the gyms were unreliable with their payments and I am currently still waiting for pay from January. This made the last 6 months really hard work and it became hard to motivate myself when I wasn't getting paid on time for any of the work I was doing.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also know the problems that managers have trying to get cover with poor signal in gyms and lots of time wasted trying to do a ring around.
              </p>
              <p>
                After realising that it wasn't just me and other instructors were effected by inconsistent pay, Fitness Cover was invented.

                I am a software architect and entrepreneur. I like to use technology to fix issues in a range of industries. When Annie told me of the inefficiencies in covering fitness classes and specifically chasing payments I decided something should be done.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working in software I enjoy the benefits of automation every day. I built the website for FitnessCover and the processes it uses to enable fitness instructors to spend less of their free time organising cover and chasing payments. Through FitnessCover I strive to enable fitness instructors to enjoy more freedom.
